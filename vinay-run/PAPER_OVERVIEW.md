## The One-Paragraph Story

We set out to improve a weak automated myopia detector (68% accuracy) by fixing its methodology. We fixed the sampling, increased resolution, and re-ran the model — and got 99.7% accuracy. Then we investigated whether that jump was real. It wasn't entirely: the source dataset contained thousands of byte-identical duplicate images, which random splitting placed across train and test. After auditing and removing those duplicates, the clean rerun gave 99.5% — still strong, but with an honest 6 missed myopia cases instead of zero. We then validated the clean model on a completely independent dataset from Chinese ophthalmic centers (PALM), achieving 81.5% accuracy and 100% precision on an unseen, harder-labeled population. Across all this, Grad-CAM confirms the model attends to retinal anatomy, not image brightness, and a CLAHE ablation confirms brightness alone cannot explain the results. The paper's contribution is therefore methodological as much as empirical: we demonstrate what rigorous ML practice looks like on a noisy public medical dataset.

## What Was Wrong Originally (train4)

The starting point was `runs/classify/train4` — a YOLOv8n model trained on ~4k images.

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Non-random sampling | First N images taken — systematic bias |
| 64×64 resolution | Loses fundus detail; native images are ~224px |
| Wrong dataset size | ~4k instead of the paper's stated 10k |
| Inverted CM narrative | Paper described confusion matrix backwards |
| Default threshold only | No threshold optimization despite suboptimal AUC |
| No explainability | No Grad-CAM — model could be using brightness, not anatomy |
| Brightness bias | Myopia class ~38 brightness points brighter — trivial shortcut |

Baseline result: **68% accuracy, 59.4% precision, 98.7% recall, AUC 0.813**

## Experiment Progression

### Phase 1 — Fix the methodology (runs A/B/C/E)

Run on a random 10k split (`data_10k/`). Dataset: Kaggle `kellysanderson/myopia-image-dataset`.
Split: seed=42, 5000/class → 3500 train / 750 val / 750 test per class.

| Run | Model | imgsz | Data | Epochs | Acc | Recall | AUC | FN |
|-----|-------|-------|------|--------|-----|--------|-----|----|
| `run_A` | YOLOv8n | 64 | 10k random | 20 | 99.67% | 99.87% | 0.9998 | 1 |
| `run_B` | YOLOv8n | 224 | 10k random | 50 | 99.80% | 100.0% | 1.0000 | 0 |
| `run_C` | YOLOv8s | 224 | 10k random | 50 | 99.73% | 100.0% | 0.9999 | 0 |
| `run_E` | YOLOv8n | 224 | 10k CLAHE | 50 | 99.80% | 100.0% | 1.0000 | 0 |

**Finding:** Methodology fix alone (random sampling + correct 10k split) took accuracy from 68% → ~99.7%.  
**Finding (run_E):** CLAHE ablation — removing brightness bias did **not** hurt accuracy. Brightness shortcut hypothesis **rejected**.

### Phase 2 — Leakage discovery

After runs A/B/C/E, we audited the source dataset.

**Full source audit (`10_audit_full_source.py`) on all 124,794 images:**

| Class | Source images | Exact MD5 dup extras | dHash=0 dup extras | Unique clusters |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Myopia | 63,294 | **8,795** | **30,078** | 33,216 |
| Normal | 61,500 | 0 | 3,732 | 57,786 |

The Myopia folder contained large mirrored filename ranges — the same images re-uploaded under different number sequences. Random splitting placed identical images in both train and test.

**Split audit (`7_leakage_audit.py`) on `data_10k`:**
- 27 exact (MD5) cross-split duplicate groups
- 245 perceptually identical (dHash=0) test↔train pairs
- Cross-class calibration confirmed signal is real, not a fundus-structure artifact

**Conclusion:** The near-perfect FN=0 results were partly artefactual. The model was tested on images it had memorized.

### Phase 3 — Clean rerun (run_C_clean)

Built `1b_sample_data_clean.py`: deduplicate by MD5 + dHash=0 per class, then sample and split.

**Clean split audit (`data_10k_clean/`):**
- 0 exact MD5 cross-split duplicates
- 0 dHash=0 cross-split duplicates ✓

**Training:** Modal A10G GPU, `modal_run_c_clean.py`. YOLOv8s, 224px, 50 epochs, early stopped at epoch 17.

**Results — `run_C_clean` on `data_10k_clean/test` (1,500 images):**

| Metric | Leaked `run_C` | Clean `run_C_clean` |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Accuracy | 99.73% | **99.53%** |
| Precision | 99.47% | **99.87%** |
| Recall | 100.0% | **99.20%** |
| F1 | 99.73% | **99.53%** |
| AUC | 0.9999 | **0.9999** |
| FP | 4 | **1** |
| **FN (missed myopia)** | **0** | **6** |

The honest clinical recall is **99.2%** with **6 missed myopia cases**, not 100% with zero.

**Threshold optimization:** Best F1 at threshold 0.15 → 100% recall, 99.7% precision. Clinically, lowering the threshold from 0.5 to 0.15 eliminates all misses with minimal cost.

### Phase 4 — External validation (PALM)

**Dataset:** PALM (Pathologic Myopia Challenge, 2019), 400 labeled fundus images from Chinese ophthalmic centers. Independent of Kaggle source. [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/palm-pathologic-myopia-challenge)

**Protocol:** Inference-only on `run_C_clean`. No retraining.

**Label mapping (filename prefix):**
- `P*` = Pathologic Myopia (213 images)
- `H*` = High Myopia, no pathology (26 images)
- `N*` = Normal (161 images)

| Mapping | n | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | AUC | FP | FN |
|---------|---|----------|-----------|--------|-----|----|----|
| Conservative (P=+, H+N=−) | 400 | **81.5%** | **100%** | **65.3%** | **0.9885** | 0 | 74 |
| Inclusive (P+H=+, N=−) | 400 | **75.0%** | **100%** | **58.2%** | **0.9578** | 0 | 100 |

**Interpretation:**
- **100% precision** — every image flagged as myopia is actually myopia on a completely unseen dataset.
- **AUC 0.96–0.99** — discriminative ability transfers cross-dataset.
- **Recall drops (~65%)** — expected: PALM's positive class is *pathologic* myopia (severe structural lesions not present in Kaggle training). The model learned general myopia features, not pathology-specific lesion signatures.
- **No false positives** — the model is not over-triggering on the new domain.

## Scientific Conclusions

1. **Methodology matters more than model choice.** The jump from 68% to ~99.5% came from fixing the split, not from a better model.

2. **Leakage in public medical datasets is real and detectable.** The Kaggle dataset contained ~8,800 exact duplicate images concentrated in the Myopia class, creating cross-split contamination. This inflated recall from 99.2% to 100% and F1 from 99.5% to 99.7%.

3. **The clean model is still strong.** 99.5% accuracy and 0.9999 AUC on a verified duplicate-free test set is a credible result.

4. **Brightness is not the explanation.** CLAHE normalization did not hurt accuracy. Grad-CAM shows attention on vessels, optic disc, and retinal tissue — not uniform brightness patterns.

5. **Cross-dataset generalization is preliminary but encouraging.** On PALM (independent Chinese clinical dataset, different label definition), AUC stays above 0.96 and precision is perfect. Recall drops, which is scientifically honest and explicable by label scope.

6. **Threshold matters clinically.** Default threshold 0.5 gives 6 FN on the clean test. Threshold 0.15 gives 0 FN — full recall — at minimal precision cost. For a screening tool, this is the operating point to deploy.
